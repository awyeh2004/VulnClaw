"""The production agent must satisfy the AgentContext seam its helpers rely on.

Helper modules annotate their handle as ``agent: AgentContext``. This test is
the drift guard for that contract: whenever a helper starts reaching for a new
member — or ``AgentCore`` drops one — the surface and the real object part ways,
and this fails.

Only the real ``AgentCore`` is required to conform. Focused test doubles
elsewhere in the suite are intentionally partial and are *not* checked here;
requiring them to implement the whole surface would defeat the point of a
narrow double.
